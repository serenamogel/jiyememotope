<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Central Park Five movie review (2012)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The case transfixed a racially polarized New York City. The teens were labeled as a "wolf pack" by the news media, led by the New York tabloids. Op-ed pieces generalized on the alleged spread of wilding among powerless young men around the country. In the documentary "Central Park Five," it's not clear precisely when the word first appeared, but it lingers as a durable meme. And that's what we remember.</p><p>What we may have forgotten, or never have known, is that the convictions of the five defendants were overturned by an appeals court after they had served 10 years behind bars. A man named Matias Reyes, already jailed as the East Side Rapist, confessed to a cellmate and was linked to the case by DNA evidence. A carefully constructed chronology established that the "wolf pack" was elsewhere in Central Park at the time — but too far away to have possibly been involved.</p><p>Yet all of the Central Park Five were recorded on tape making full and detailed confessions to the crime. How could this be? This documentary by the respected <a href=#>Ken Burns</a>, his daughter Sarah and her husband <a href=#>David McMahon</a> suggests the confessions were browbeaten out of them after hours of nonstop questioning. Although they mentioned specific details of the assault, they seem to have been suggested to them by the police.</p><p>In outline, this story is uncannily similar to another wrongful conviction involving the "West Memphis Three." As it happens, I viewed the new doc "<a href=#>West of Memphis</a>" not long ago. In this case, the Three were convicted and one was sentenced to death on charges of sexually assaulting and murdering three little boys. In both cases the police/media narratives about the defendants inflamed public sentiment.</p><p>In New York, the image of violent young blacks was frightening, and in West Memphis, Ark., there was the scarcely less terrifying allegation that the defendants were members of a "satanic cult." Both prosecutions were based on confessions. Both convictions were overturned after others confessed and matched DNA evidence. Race was not the only factor; non-whites in New York were as horrified as whites at the violent and lawless behavior of the assailants.</p><p>Our justice system presumes defendants are innocent until proven guilty. It also places extreme pressure on the police to make arrests leading to convictions — to "solve" the crimes. The police officers knew, or should have known, that the confessions involved were extracted by psychological force (the Arkansas case was obtained from a young boy who was mentally retarded). If a heinous crime ends with a popular conviction, the system is satisfied. Nobody wants to hear contradictory evidence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk5q7tb7ApWSpmaKgeqe11Z5ka2hhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-you-in-the-morning-1989.html><span>←</span><span>See You In The Morning movie review (1989)</span></a>
