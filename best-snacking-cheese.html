But what if you have somewhere to be? That’s where the best snacking cheese comes in. The best cheese snacks are at the very intersection of comfort and get-up-and-go, just like sweat pants or <a href=#>canned wine</a>. You can barely go wrong with snacking cheese as it is, but these cheeses are the best of the best.</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Sprouts Market Corner Low-Moisture Part-Skim String Cheese</a></strong><p>Far be it from me to order you around, but you should really reconnect with your inner child. One way to do that is by engaging in the kid-friendly activity of peeling string cheese strand by strand. When it comes to the best cheese snacks, string cheese is in a league of its own. And in our ranking of the best string cheese, this snacking cheese from Sprouts won because it’s basically string cheese in its most perfect form. Sporked senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> said that it’s “the perfect balance of waxy and pliable. Even though it’s part-skim, the flavor is full fat.” —Angela Guglielmino</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the </strong><a href=#><strong>best cheese sticks</strong></a></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sargento Pepper Jack Cheese Sticks</strong></a><p>Don’t worry, I’m not the infamous Abby Lee Miller, so I don’t believe that “second place is the first to lose.” These Sargento Pepper Jack Cheese Sticks came in second in our ranking of the best cheese sticks because they pack a lot of flavor and the jalapeño pepper adds dimension to the typical snacking cheese experience. You don’t have to settle for flavorless cheese just because you’re in snacking mode. —Angela Guglielmino</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the </strong><a href=#><strong>best cheese sticks</strong></a></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tillamook Medium Cheddar Cheese Snacks</a></strong><p>Eating this cheese is like eating the baby version of a full block of cheese—Block Jr., if you will. Now, Block Jr. and I have gone on many adventures to the movies, in the car, bouncing around in my at-home office chair, and I can, in fact, report that she’s an all-terrain kind of snacking cheese. It’s an appropriate, socially acceptable amount of cheese to have in a public setting, plus, it’s Tillamook cheddar, so you know it’s good. Block Jr., congrats. You’re one of the best cheese snacks at the grocery store. —Naajia Shukri</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Vermont Creamery Bijou Crottin</a></strong><p>Vermont Creamery Bijou Crottin is GOATed, literally. If you’re not familiar, a crottin is a small round of goat cheese, and these come two in a pack, which makes them some of the best snacking cheese. The rind has a little bit of farm yard-y funk, and the cheese inside is tangy and creamy. If you’re looking for the best snacking cheese to smear on a cracker, this is it. —Angela Guglielmino</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the </strong><a href=#><strong>best goat cheese</strong></a></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Daiya Dairy-Free Mozzarella Style Deluxe Cheeze Sticks</a></strong><p>We’ve got you covered if you’re dairy-free (or aspiring to be dairy-free). These individually wrapped Daiya vegan cheese snacks are surprisingly good. Jordan called these “actually cheesy and salty,” and said they’d be thrilled to get one in their lunch box. If real milk mozzarella isn’t on the menu for you, these cheese snacks are a grate alternative. Sometimes the best snacking cheese is actually “cheeze”!—Angela Guglielmino</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the </strong><a href=#><strong>best cheese sticks</strong></a></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Bel Gioso Fresh Mozzarella Snacking Cheese</a></strong><p>I never knew I craved tiny balls of mozzarella before discovering these snack packs. They’re perfect for when you crave a mild cheese or are making a very small salad. These are the shots of the cheese world, because you truly can just knock some back and go about your business. Each pack contains three bite-sized mozzarella balls, which seems like a nice way to pace your cheese consumption, however, I must warn that they are as easy to inhale as they are adorable. —Naajia Shukri</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BEST-TRADER-JOES-CHEESE-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_HEADER.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-cheeses-at-trader-joe-s><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Cheeses at Trader Joe’s</a></h2><p class=related-date>April 14, 2022</p><p>Trader Joe’s is for cheese.
