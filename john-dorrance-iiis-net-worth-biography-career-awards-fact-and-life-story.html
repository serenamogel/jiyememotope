John Dorrance, III, being the grandson of Campbell soup founder, John Dorrance I, made his fortune after he cashed out the family business. In a one-year period, from 1995 to 1996, he sold much of his inherited 10.5% stake in Campbell Soup for $1.5 billion. Thus he made a well-timed bet right before the stock plunged. Another smart step he took was renouncing US citizenship and moving to Ireland shortly before he did the selling, in order to avoid estate and capital gains taxes on coming windfall. Since then, he has led a quiet life in the south part of Ireland’s capital Dublin, from time to time going to the Bahamas with his Finish wife. In the past, he joined various movements to legalize game ranching in Wyoming and fox hunting in Great Britain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfnbtusM6rqZqmk5p6qrXIrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNis6Kv02aYp5xdobansYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inderpaul-sandhu-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-613391-html.html><span>←</span><span>InderPaul Sandhu Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
