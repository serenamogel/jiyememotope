He used a home video camera and computer, recruited his friends to be actors, and searched for props in his family’s basement. Seeing this, his parents encouraged him to enroll in acting classes. A member of the Austin Musical Theater program, Glen earned a role as an understudy for the male lead in The Music Man in 2000 and also appeared in productions of The Sound of Music and Oliver! at the city’s Paramount Theater.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even today, Glen Sr. and Cyndy maintain an active role in their son’s life and career and have made cameos in a number of his films.

He later studied radio, TV, and film at the University of Texas at Austin but didn’t complete his degree.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Movies: Top Gun: Maverick and Anyone But You" data-anchor-id=movies-top-gun-maverick-and-anyone-but-you class="body-h2 css-1a93ikt emt9r7s1">Movies: Top Gun: Maverick and Anyone But You</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Powell’s location in Austin helped him land his first onscreen role as a “Long-fingered Boy” in the 2003 children’s adventure sequel Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, which was filmed and produced in the city. Director Robert Rodriguez discovered Powell, then 14, while looking for “local hires” to accompany the primarily Los Angeles-based cast. “You’re just trying to find someone locally that won’t get nervous, that’ll give a performance that kind of measures up to the other actors.

Powell originally auditioned for, and failed to earn, the role of primary supporting character Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/miles-alexander-teller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miles Teller" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Miles Teller</a>) but stayed on the project after Cruise called him personally and praised his audition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Powell underwent extensive training for the film, including underwater escape simulations and flights in F-18 aircraft to prepare for the G-forces he would experience on camera.

Instead, “Hangman” became one of Top Gun: Maverick’s most memorable figures. “It was a leap of faith.
