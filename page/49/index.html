These coolers are sufficient for running a CPU at stock frequencies out of the box, but few stock coolers are built large enough to above and beyond the basics, to deliver impressive thermal and/or acoustic performance. As a result, it's still pretty typical for power users and enthusiasts to go hunting for a more advanced solution&nbsp;– and there's a sizable market of coolers waiting to be found.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hugo Chvez - Death, Daughter &amp;amp; Family</h2><time>Apr 20, 2024</time>

He shared his dismay in a letter to his son that read, "Chartran has been painting my picture. I do not particularly like it" (via Boundary Stones). The artist had a bit of difficulty painting the president, and he said that although he was witty and charming, he couldn't sit still.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Store Vegetables to Keep Them Fresh</h2><time>Apr 19, 2024</time>
