Bobby Boucher, the waterboy, is one of those people who is so insufferable, in a passive-aggressive way, that you have to believe they know what they're doing. No one could be that annoying by accident. I am occasionally buttonholed by such specimens. They stand too close, they talk too loudly, they are not looking at me but at an invisible Teleprompter somewhere over my shoulder. If I were a man of action, I would head-butt them and take my chances with the courts.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Davids heart-wrenching fate in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, explained</h2><time>Apr 8, 2024</time>

hello macaron / guest recipe / gluten free
About two years ago, I had this idea that Jack and I could start a food blog together. I thought it would be fun to try new things, and to chronicle our highs and inevitable lows. On my list of foods I thought would be “fun” to tackle: macarons. We both love them… good ones are often hard to find… so by all means we should make them ourselves.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Preachers Graham McTavish On The Cowboys New Mission</h2><time>Apr 7, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Though Scottish actor Graham McTavish (The Hobbit) is still listed as playing “The Cowboy” on AMC’s small-screen adaptation of Preacher, at this stage of the series it’s become quite obvious that he is, in fact, The Saint of Killers – the immortal, vengeance-fueled force of nature from Garth Ennis’ comic series.
On&nbsp;this past Sunday’s penultimate episode, we saw The Saint relive his own personal Hell over and over again until Fiore and Deblanc pay him a little visit with an offer he really can’t refuse: seek out and kill Jesse Custer, and his torment will end.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Spicy Mayo</h2><time>Apr 7, 2024</time>

It would be hard to overstate how much I love spicy mayo. Maybe you can relate? It’s creamy, it’s zingy, it’s full of fiery spice.

Healthy non-dairy muffins packed with carrots and topped with coconut whipped cream.
spring / dairy free
Spring is in the air (at least, here in Austin it is), and I’ve been getting non-stop carrots in my Farmhouse Delivery box. Which means one thing to us… carrot cake. This time, in muffin form.
I topped these with coconut whip lightly sweetened with maple syrup. It’s airy, yet creamy… much less indulgent than a more traditional cream cheese frosting, but it was exactly what I was in the mood for this time.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/52/>← Prev Page</a>
