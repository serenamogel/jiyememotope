The pair might have had the chance to spark if it weren't for the fact that Humberly does indeed already have a boyfriend! His name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Groeneweg</a>, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Legit</a>, they’ve been in a relationship since 2015.</p><p>Humberly's Instagram doesn’t do much to show off her relationship with Jonathan, since she posts a lot of gorgeous solo modeling shots, selfies, profiles of her various makeup looks, full-body outfits of the day, fashionista poses, snaps with her puppies, and pics of what it looks like behind the scenes on the sets of her many projects.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Jonathan's Instagram, on the other hand, does a lot to show off his relationship with her!

Thanks for encouraging and sticking by me just the same, and helping me grow into the most complete and authentic version of myself, even when I am my own biggest obstacle. I can’t wait to see what our future holds.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another caption from 2020</a>, he wrote, “Five years ago today, on a day not too unlike this one, I woke up blissfully unaware that I was about to meet the love of my life… and we’ve been inseparable ever since. Thank you Humberly for all the good, no, great times that have come and gone, as well as those still to come." The way he talks about the future with her speaks volumes about what might happen next for this happy couple. They appear to be very much in love!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncKursSro7Jll6S7u63LnrFmoKWor6K6ww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-munger-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Munger Net Worth: How Much Was Charlie Munger Worth?</span></a>
