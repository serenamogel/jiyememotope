It's a comedy of the 1940s and 1950s sort, produced by a master of that older style, <a href=#>Stanley Shapiro</a>, whose big hit was "Pillow Talk" (1959). Like that one, it has two main ingredients. First, there's got to be a mildly daring social issue to tickle the audience, but not too much. This time, it's whether mistresses should have legal rights like wives. So <a href=#>Dean Martin</a> tries to save his buddy (<a href=#>Eli Wallach</a>) from an unfaithful mistress (<a href=#>Anne Jackson</a>). But he gets his signals crossed and thinks Wallach's mistress is <a href=#>Stella Stevens</a>. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's stuck with the wrong mistress.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hprBlpKR6tK3VnmSaZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZpmemXqzwcinZLKnpad6rbXFnmRqcWZt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-denzongpa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-528642-html.html><span>←</span><span>Danny Denzongpa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
