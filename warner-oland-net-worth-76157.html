Educated in Boston, he spoke <a href=#>English</a> and his native <a href=#>Swedish</a>, and eventually translated some of the plays of August Strindberg. As a young man he pursued a career in theater, at first working on set design while developing his skills as a dramatic actor. In 1906, he was signed to tour the country with the troupe led by <a href=#>Actress</a> Alla Nazimova. The following year he met and married the <a href=#>Playwright</a> and portrait <a href=#>Painter</a> Edith Gardener Shearn. Shearn made an ideal partner for Oland. She mastered <a href=#>Swedish</a>, helping him with the translation of Strindberg's works that they jointly published in book form in 1912.</p><span>1912</span><p>After several years in theater, including appearances on Broadway as Warner Oland, in 1912 he made his silent film debut in <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, a film based on the <a href=#>John Bunyan</a> novel. It would be another three years before he returned to film work with a role in <i>The Romance of Elaine</i>, an adventure film starring the extremely popular Pearl White. As a result of his training as a Shakespearean actor and his easy adoption of a sinister look, he was much in demand as a villain and in ethnic roles. He made several more films with Pearl White including his first portrayal of an oriental character in her film, <i>The Lightning Raider</i> (1919). Over the next 15 years, he appeared in more than 30 films, including a major role in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (1927), one of the first talkies produced.</p><span>1929</span><p>Oland's normal appearance fit the Hollywood expectation of caricatured Asianness of the time, despite his having no definitively proven Asian cultural background. Oland portrayed a variety of Asian characters in several movies before being offered the leading role in the 1929 film, <i>The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu.</i> It was the first onscreen portrayal of the Fu Manchu character in film. Oland continued to appear onscreen as an Asian, probably more often than any other white actor in the history of cinema. In <i>Old San Francisco</i>, Oland played an Asian unsuccessfully impersonating a white man.</p><span>1930</span><p>The enormous worldwide box office success of his Charlie Chan film led to more, with Oland starring in 16 Chan films in total. The series, Jill Lepore later wrote, "kept Fox afloat" during the 1930s, while earning Oland $40,000 per movie. Oland took his role seriously, studying the <a href=#>Chinese</a> language and calligraphy.</p><span>1931</span><p>A box office success, <i>The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu</i> made Oland a star, and during the next two years he portrayed the evil Dr. Fu Manchu in three more films (althought, the second one was purely a cameo appearance). Firmly locked into such roles, he was cast as Charlie Chan in the international detective mystery film <i>Charlie Chan Carries On</i> (1931) and then in <a href=#>Director</a> Josef von Sternberg's 1932 classic film <i>Shanghai Express</i> opposite Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong.</p><span>1935</span><p>Oland was the first actor to play a werewolf in a major Hollywood film, biting the protagonist, played by Henry Hull, in <i>Werewolf of London</i> (1935). Once again, Oland's character was Asian.</p><span>1938</span><p>In <a href=#>Sweden</a>, Oland contracted bronchial pneumonia, worsened by the apparent onset of emphysema from years of heavy cigarette smoking and he died in a hospital in Stockholm. Oland's last film was the unfinished <i>Charlie Chan at the Ringside</i>. Fox reshot Oland's scenes with Peter Lorre and released the finished picture as <i>Mr. Moto's Gamble</i> (1938). Following cremation in <a href=#>Sweden</a>, his ashes were brought back to the United States by his ex-wife for interment in the Southborough Rural Cemetery in Southborough, <a href=#>Massachusetts</a>, a suburb of Boston, where the Olands had previously resided in an historic farmhouse.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1879 births</a> <a href=#>1938 deaths</a> <a href=#>Swedish male stage actors</a> <a href=#>Swedish male film actors</a> <a href=#>Swedish male silent film actors</a> <a href=#>20th-century Swedish male actors</a> <a href=#>Deaths from pneumonia</a> <a href=#>Deaths from emphysema</a> <a href=#>Swedish emigrants to the United States</a> <a href=#>August Strindberg</a> <a href=#>People from Southborough, Massachusetts</a> <a href=#>Swedish–English translators</a> <a href=#>People from Bjurholm Municipality</a> <a href=#>20th-century American male actors</a> <a href=#>20th Century Fox contract players</a> <a href=#>20th-century translators</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmenlr%2BvsdFmpqWZnpl6r7HTZq6oqqSdeniCkG5u</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-nelson.html><span>←</span><span>How did Writer Matthew Nelson die ?
