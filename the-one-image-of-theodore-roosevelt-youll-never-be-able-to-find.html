However, upon seeing the progress, Roosevelt wasn't pleased with the outcome. He shared his dismay in a letter to his son that read, "Chartran has been painting my picture. I do not particularly like it" (via <a href=#>Boundary Stones</a>). The artist had a bit of difficulty painting the president, and he said that although he was witty and charming, he couldn't sit still.</p><p dir=ltr>The portrait was completed soon after, and Roosevelt's entire family didn't appreciate it. His children made fun of it, and it became a joke in the family. Roosevelt said that he looked like a "mewing cat" in the portrait. Upon its completion, the painting was brought to <a href=#>France</a> for an exhibition, and the public loved it. However, the public's perception didn't change Roosevelt's view of the painting. When it was returned to the White House, the president decided that he didn't want it to be displayed where it could be seen by many people. "Neither the President nor his wife has ever liked the portrait. It was hung in the upper corridor, in the darkest spot on the wall, and by the family, it has always been called the Mewing Cat," said Archibald Aide, Roosevelt's aide, as reported by <a href=#>Clinton White House</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCknBucmpfqbWmec6nnGahnZa0pnnOn2StoJWksbC%2BxGapqKejmsOmuNNmsKitnKF6r7HVnqlmmpVirqO4xGarqGWWnrulew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./political-figures.html><span>←</span><span>Hugo Chvez - Death, Daughter &amp;amp; Family</span></a>
