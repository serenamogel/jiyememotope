In the early 2010s, film audiences couldn’t get enough of dystopian YA series and studios were constantly on the lookout for the next big thing —the next billion dollar book-to-film franchise to rival the likes of success stories like The Hunger Games. When the first Maze Runner film came out in 2014, it checked all the boxes needed for a hit series: a popular YA book trilogy (written by author James Dashner) as the source material, a cast full of young popular leading actors, and a (slightly forced) love triangle.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ana Vidovi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>
