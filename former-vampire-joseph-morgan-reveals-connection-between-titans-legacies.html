In the DC show, Morgan plays Sebastian Sanger/Brother Blood. An awkward taxidermist who has dreams of selling the interactive video game he’s developed. Luck isn’t on Sanger’s side, however, as a string of unfortunate events plague the man and could send him down a darker path.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>His portrayal as this new character has been one of the most anticipated parts of Titans season four. He seemed like the perfect casting to play Brother Blood, a classic Teen Titans villain who leads the Cult of Blood, but he’s said that he wanted to be very careful about how he approached the character. Morgan took his time in helping develop his backstory so that audiences could empathize with him before he makes that villainous turn.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Sebastian isn’t the only person dealing with some heavy issues. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superboy gets an invite to meet Superman</a> and all doesn’t go as planned. Lex Luthor (Titus Welliver) is there and he has other intentions for the Boy of Steel that could also push him to the darker side if he’s not careful.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>The Titans are investigating a series of deaths revolving around the occult.
