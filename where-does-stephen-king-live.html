With a plethora of successful novels having been transformed into major movie and television adaptations, King has easily become a household name in the horror realm.

Even so, interest has reached further heights due to questions about King’s permanent residence and where he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">draws his spine-tingling inspiration</a> from.</p><h2 id=h-where-does-stephen-king-live data-injectable=false>Where does Stephen King live?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/stephen-king-1.jpg><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>One of the most famous residences in all of Maine belongs to the famed novelist, with the location in Bangor providing endless inspiration for a variety of stories.

Seeing as King’s net worth is in the hundreds of millions, it’s obvious he could reside in an undoubtedly lavish location with a relatively warm climate most of the year, but King has historically remained close to his roots.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>That being said, an article from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> back in 2019 explained that due to public knowledge and overwhelming visits from tourists, King and his wife Tabitha will instead make their second home in Florida their permanent residence of choice. Seeing as King is notorious for being one of the most famous and popular horror writers ever, it makes perfect sense why the Kings would want to venture elsewhere and maintain some privacy.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Since King’s permanent move to his Florida home, his jaw-dropping residence back in Bangor, Maine has since been transformed into both a museum and a retreat for writers. The ideas were apparently approved by Bangor City Council, where King is still considered to be a significant figure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnmSdp5WoerTAxKmfnqZdoLavs4yloK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./user-playerking95.html><span>←</span><span>User:Playerking95/Guzma (anime) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
