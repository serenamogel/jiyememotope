<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Blood Money movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In a nod to the long history of fiction and films in which money divides unions—the film is reportedly loosely inspired by “<a href=#>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>,” believe it or not—Jeff, Lynn and Victor have a tough time agreeing on what do with the found fortune. Good guy Victor immediately wants to turn it in, knowing that no good can come of bags of money found in the woods. Lynn has other ideas. Screwed over by a bad knee that has derailed her future, at least in her mind, she sees the money as karmic justice for the shit she’s had to put up with, and “Blood Money” gets way more interesting when Lynn’s search for retribution gains a bit of a gender-edge. Fitzgerald totally sells a great scene in which Lynn rails about how she was an equal friend of Victor and Jeff’s until she hit puberty and became property to fight over. I wish “Blood Money” invested more time and energy in this theme of male possessiveness, especially earlier, when the film feels unfocused and uncertain.</p><p>Part of that first hour feels borderline incomplete. The dialogue is clunky&nbsp;in such a way that you’ll think your DVD skipped a few seconds, and the characters are weirdly inconsistent. There’s an “exposition while the kids drink a few” scene early on that is bafflingly written and edited. The rhythm is all off. And McKee, so good at bringing tension and atmosphere to “<a href=#>May</a>” and “The Woman,” can’t get excited about this material. It’s filmed in a flat, dull way that brings nothing to the piece. When you start to wonder if the film is making continuity errors—I swear it goes from overcast to sunny and back again a few times—you know something’s wrong. As for Cusack, he’s having a little bit of fun, but this is closer to the paycheck roles he often takes than it probably should have or could have been. As “Blood Money” becomes more and more about two dummies who really don’t get&nbsp;the woman they’re fighting over, it becomes more interesting. It’s just too far down the B-movie river to be saved by that point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo6inlGK6sLrEsmRraGFs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nascar-news-you-had-vision-no-one-around-us-had-kenny-wallace-pens-heartfelt-message-to-dale-jrs-closest-confidant-amidst-final-mic-drop.html><span>←</span><span>You Had Vision No One Around Us Had- Kenny Wallace Pens Heartfelt Message toDale Jrs Close</span></a>
