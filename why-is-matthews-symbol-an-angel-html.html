 Answer
The winged figure, or angel, who represents Matthew the Evangelist, the author of the first gospel report, is represented as a cherub. Matthew’s gospel begins with Joseph’s lineage back to Abraham; this depicts Jesus’ Incarnation and, as a result, Christ’s human essence in the flesh. This implies that Christians should rely on their own personal reasons for salvation.

He was not one of the original 12 Apostles, but he may have been one of the 70 disciples who were chosen by Jesus to serve as his apostles (Luke 10). St. Paul’s missionary missions may have have included him as a travel companion.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the scientific name for a flying lion?</h3><p>Lammasu was also known by the name of Shedu, and he was regarded as a protecting god.

This was the earliest known usage of the symbol, which dates back to 1536.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the symbol for the name “Luke”?</h3><p>The winged ox or bull, which represents Luke the Evangelist, the author of the third gospel narrative (as well as the Acts of the Apostles), is an emblem of sacrifice, service, and power in the Christian faith.</p><p></p><h3>Is Mark the same person as John Mark, and vice versa?</h3><p>In the Acts of the Apostles, John Mark is mentioned as an aide who accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their missionary missions.
