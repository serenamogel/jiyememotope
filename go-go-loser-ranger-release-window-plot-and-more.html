Go! Go! Loser Ranger! will be directed by Keiichiro Ochi, who has famously worked on Black Butler and Under Ninja. Furthermore, it will be produced by Yostar Pictures, which has produced some pretty impressive stuff, including Blue Archive and Azure Lane. Altogether, it’s obvious that with this creative team, the upcoming anime is in very good hands.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=23 data-current-count=23 data-injectable=false>The main cast includes:</p><ul data-current-count=373.5 data-injectable=false><li>Yusuke Kobayashi as Foot Soldier D</li><li>Yumika Yano as Yumeko Suzukiri</li><li>Daishi Kajita as Hibiki Sakurama</li><li>Yuichi Nakamura as Red Keeper</li><li>Go Inoue as Blue Keeper</li><li>M.A.O as Pink Keeper</li><li>Kohsuke Toriumi as Green Keeper</li><li>Kensho Ono as Yellow Keeper</li></ul><h2 data-injectable=false>Go!

Go! Loser Ranger!" (Sentai Daishikkaku) will have NEW ANIME INFORMATIONS delivered on March 24's Blue Stage at AnimeJapan 2024.

Go! Loser Ranger! is a spin on the Super Sentai trope of anime, which was widely popularized by shows like Power Rangers. While most shows like these focus on paladin heroes who often have to face and eliminate otherworldly threats, the upcoming anime is uniquely told from the villain’s perspective.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>However, instead of a story about defeating the bad guys, in Go! Go! Loser Ranger, the “Executives of the Villainous Army of Evil” were already defeated by the Dragon Keepers. Now, thirteen years later, the foot soldiers of the Villainous Army are forced to reenact their defeat and serve under the Dragon Keepers. The anime follows one of these soldiers, Foot Soldier D, who decides to infiltrate the ranks of the Dragon Keepers, and end their oppression once and for all.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Overall, Go! Go! Loser Ranger! is a compelling interrogation of what constitutes good and evil, as the Dragon Keepers, who are meant to be the good guys, are not all that they seem on the surface.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6gpmafn2K5sL%2FEq2SrmZ6csrN50Z6jnpmjmnq4tc2dprBloKG8tXnAp5tmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeopardy-winners-tournament-of-champions-writers-strike-1235679799.html><span>←</span><span>'Jeopardy!'
