<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Irene Mott Obituary, Beloved Of Lebanon, And Former Coordinator At The Arnold Air Force Base Off</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Irene Mott Obituary, Death –&nbsp;</strong>The 85-year-old Mrs. Irene Mott passed away on December 19th, 2023, at Vanderbilt-Wilson County Hospital, and her passing has left Lebanon in mourning. Many people will never forget her unfaltering devotion to her loved ones and the community, as well as her acts of selflessness. Irene Messenger Coffey was born to parents Robert and Pearl in Enid, Oklahoma, and her life was a model of selfless service.</p><p>She was a caring certified nursing assistant at Brightwork Living, a coordinator at the officer’s club at Arnold Air Force Base, and a beloved figure known as “Mama Mott” to the firefighters at the base fire department while her husband Jay was there. Her selflessness shone through all of her roles. Beyond her professional life, Irene was deeply committed to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She served in the Young Women’s Presidency, taught Primary children, and participated in Girl’s Camp for an incredible 22 years, continuing until she was 85 years old.</p><p>Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother were her most treasured roles, though. She took great pleasure in caring for her family, and her love for her great-grandchildren and grandchildren shone through in her life. Bill McLemore, Dorothy McLemore Stevenson, and JL Mott were the three children that Irene lost, along with brothers Robert and Frank Coffey. Her children Randy, Annette, Jodie, and Shawn, as well as her thirteen grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, follow in the footsteps of her cherished husband, Jay Mott.</p><p>Those who wish to pay their respects can do so on December 28, 2023, at the Tullahoma Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Bishop Jared Bryan will officiate the funeral service at 1:00 pm, and Rose Hill Memorial Gardens will be the final resting place for her. As a symbol of love, service, and devotion, Mrs. Irene Mott left an everlasting impression on everyone whose lives she touched. With her departure, an era comes to a close. All who were fortunate enough to know her will carry her example of generosity and selflessness with them forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admoqqVo7Juuc6tq2ankp7Btq3RsmSbnZykw6awjKidZqSVl66vu81mmKecXZu8s7nEq2Scp5%2Bnsaq6wK2mq2WRqXq1tMRmmKumn6Gxbq3Iq2Sfp6KYsm6uwKycZqeWm7aksdGsZJykpZd6qa3SZqqanJyuerGt0qycnWWRrK66ecOemK2gXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-bird-sounds-like-a-creaking-door.html><span>←</span><span>What bird sounds like a creaking door?</span></a>
