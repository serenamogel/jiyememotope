During her Camp Rock days, the Disney starlet was hiding her drug usage from the adults in her life.&nbsp;In her documentary Simply Complicated (via <a href=#>Refinery29</a>), the "Sober" singer revealed that things finally boiled over when she punched her background dancer on tour. Her family and management staged an intervention, and the singer reportedly checked into rehab following a two-month, cocaine-fueled bender.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>ABC News</a>, the star also revealed that she'd been struggling with self-harm and bulimia, which she developed as a child after being bullied about her weight.&nbsp;"I was performing concerts on an empty stomach," she told ABC News. "I was losing my voice from purging. I was self-medicating. I was not taking medication for depression, and I literally was so emotionally whacked out that I took it out on someone that meant a lot to me."&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2011,&nbsp;the starlet confirmed to <a href=#>People</a> that she'd be leaving her Disney series Sonny with a Chance and focusing on music. "I don't think going back to Sonny would be healthy for my recovery," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxmZYN2e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2ptaa%2FxGaqrZmiqHqtscWtZJ2ho6OyunnBnp%2BippRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-shahi-eating-disorder-does-she-have-anorexia-and-cancer.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Shahi Eating Disorder: Does She Have Anorexia And Cancer?</span></a>
