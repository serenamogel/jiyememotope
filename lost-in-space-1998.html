<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Lost in Space movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The movie doesn't bother with such details. After a space battle that is the predictable curtain-raiser, and a quick explanation of why and how the Robinson family is setting off for a planet called Alpha Prime, the film takes place mostly onboard their saucer-shaped ship, and involves many more space battles, showdowns, struggles, attacks, hyperspace journeys, and exploding planets. In between, the characters plow through creaky dialogue and exhausted relationship problems.</p><p>Imagine the film that could be made about a family marooned on a distant planet, using what they could salvage from their ship or forage from the environment. That screenplay would take originality, intelligence and thought.</p><p>“Lost in Space” is one of those typing-speed jobs where the screenwriter is like a stenographer, rewriting what he's seen at the movies.</p><p>The story: Earth will not survive another two decades. Alpha Prime is the only other habitable planet mankind has discovered. Prof. John Robinson (<a href=#>William Hurt</a>) and his family have been chosen to go there and construct a hypergate, to match the gate at the earth end. Their journey will involve years of suspended animation, but once the other gate is functioning, humans can zip instantaneously to Alpha Prime.</p><p>There needs to be a hypergate at both ends, of course, because otherwise there's no telling where a hyperdrive will land you--as the Robinsons soon find out. Also onboard are the professor's wife Maureen (<a href=#>Mimi Rogers</a>), their scientist daughter Judy Robinson (<a href=#>Heather Graham</a>), their younger daughter Penny (<a href=#>Lacey Chabert</a>), and their son Will (<a href=#>Jack Johnson</a>), who is the brains of the outfit. The ship is piloted by ace space cadet Don West (Matt LeBlanc), and includes an intelligent robot who will help with the tasks at the other hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpqysXZ67br%2FPmpqeZWFuhnk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roddy-mcdowall.html><span>←</span><span>Roddy McDowall movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
