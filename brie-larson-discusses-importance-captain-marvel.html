“So I felt the importance of creating a symbol when I was making Captain Marvel… but once I’m done on set filming, and then especially when the movie’s out, I am here to allow people to know that there’s an experience they can have access to if they want, but it’s not mine anymore."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

You know, and Captain Marvel‘s definitely not mine anymore. And it makes me so thrilled that it’s beyond me. It wasn’t until I actually had the action figure in my hand that I was, like, ‘Whoa! Kids can now be on the floor, and Captain Marvel can have unlimited experiences.'”</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>While the titular superhero often suffers a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unfair internet backlash</a>, there’s also a huge segment of the population that loves the feminist icon and the actress who plays her. After all, Larson was named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumblr’s top actress in 2019</a>, while Carol Danvers&nbsp;was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular female Halloween costume this year</a> and is expected to become the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">face of the MCU</a> in the near future. She’s already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slated to appear in at least five more movies in the cinematic universe</a>, too, so it sounds like Captain Marvel is here to stay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/78881768_214069682923618_3199223520981324352_n.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, there’s certainly a growing sentiment that Larson needs to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from the role</a> in favor of someone else. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney has reportedly lost a bit of confidence</a> in the outspoken actress, who they feel might have a tough time winning over audiences after her big debut. This is perhaps highlighted by the fact that the company recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">removed the character from the marketing for their new streaming service</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">neglected to recommend Captain Marvel for any Oscars</a>.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>As such, it’s difficult to predict how things will ultimately turn out for Larson in the MCU, but it seems that Carol Danvers won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. Especially since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Captain Marvel 2</strong></a> is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">likely to be premiering some time in 2022</a>, and once we hear of a more concrete release date, we’ll be sure to let you know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomauhlWK5or7SqKVmnJmosLa%2F0p6qZqGdpbyzwMCnmp5lk5a9ta3Ip2SmmaKrsq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beautiful-youtube-celebrities-women.html><span>←</span><span>Top Beautiful YouTube Celebrities Women Ranked</span></a>
