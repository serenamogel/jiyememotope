I want something soft like applesauce, and thanks to Sporked’s <a href=#>best applesauce ranking</a>, we know exactly which applesauce to reach for in a time such as this. In writer Danny Palumbo’s review of 365’s Unsweetened Applesauce, he wrote, “Whole Foods’ applesauce doesn’t have a ton of added sugar, so it’s not cloying like many other name brand applesauces.” This is one applesauce that you can eat a great deal of without feeling overwhelmed by sweetness, and if we’re avoiding solid food for the day, this is a great place to start.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Applesauce: The 7 Best Applesauces to Savor With a Spoon</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Signature Select Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal</strong></a><p>Maple and brown sugar is the best flavor of oatmeal, and the best maple and brown sugar oatmeal out there comes from Signature Select. In her ranking of the <a href=#>best instant oatmeal flavors</a>, editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> praised this oatmeal for being extremely comforting, something that’s needed when you can’t stop thinking about how much your throat hurts every time you swallow. “The maple flavors will remind you of childhood pancakes and the creamy texture will sooth your innards. It’s a hug from the inside,” she wrote. You can count on this oatmeal to feel like a hug inside that will soothe your throat.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Instant Oatmeal Flavors for a Wholesome (But Not Too Wholesome) Breakfast</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Oikos Lemon Meringue Greek Yogurt</strong></a><p>Greek yogurt is another easy option when your throat hurts, and Oikos has some really fun flavors. Their Lemon Meringue flavor, as managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> pointed out in her ranking of the <a href=#>best greek yogurt flavors</a>, is particularly delicious. “The tartness of the lemon and the natural tartness of the rich, decadent yogurt are a match made in heaven,” she wrote. With yogurt this tasty, you’ll forget your throat is sore and finish the whole cup. You’ll be coming back to this desserty yogurt even after your throat feels better.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grab a Spoon for the 6 Best Greek Yogurt Flavors</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Quaker Instant Grits</strong></a><p>Instant grits are one of human kind’s greatest achievements, and when you add an egg and a bit of cheddar cheese into the mix, this is a hot and protein-packed homemade meal to sooth a sore throat. Instant grits are as easy to make as they are to eat, and even if you don’t feel up to adding any garnishes, even a dab of butter will make this bowl feel like a tasty embrace. This warm, buttery dish is one that I reach for with or without a sore throat, because it is that good.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rao’s Chicken Noodle Soup</strong></a><p>If there’s anything you can count on to get you through a sore throat, it’s chicken noodle soup. Just any chicken noodle soup, you ask? Nope. Remember Rao’s Chicken Noodle Soup from our <a href=#>best chicken noodle soup</a> ranking? In our opinion, it’s the best soup you can buy for a sore throat. Danny wrote in his ranking that “Rao’s nails the seasoning and flavor, and the quality ingredients are all top notch. It’s like your grandma made it and put it in one of her jars.” Well, we definitely trust our respective grandmas to know what foods are best for a sore throat. This soup is as flavorful as it is comforting, and we trust that it will save the day—or at least fill you up.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bust Out the Big Spoons for the Best Chicken Noodle Soup</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuss6om2aen6d6onnSqKmeZaSdv7Ct02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asus-vp28uqg-gaming-monitor-28-inch-4k-freesync.html><span>←</span><span>ASUS Adds Entry-Level VP28UQG to Gaming LCD Lineup: 28, 4K, FreeSync, 1ms</span></a>
