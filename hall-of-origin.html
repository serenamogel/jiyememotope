In <a href=# title="Generation IV">Generation IV</a>, the Azure Flute was an <a href=# title="Event item">event item</a> that was never distributed, but it can be obtained through regular gameplay in <a href=# title="Generation VIII">Generation VIII</a>.</p><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Legends: Arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, the Hall of Origin is not labeled as such, and is instead treated as part of the <a href=# title="Temple of Sinnoh">Temple of Sinnoh</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_core_series>In the core series</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_IV>Generation IV</span></h3><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions">Pokémon Diamond, Pearl</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon Platinum Version">Platinum</a>, when the player returns to the Spear Pillar with the Azure Flute, they will be asked to blow into it every time they step one tile north from the entrance until they catch Arceus. Upon doing so, a glowing staircase will appear, leading to an elevated glass platform high above the Spear Pillar, where Arceus awaits the player's challenge. The camera will also broadly <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Tilt (camera)">tilt</a> overhead and zoom out, giving the player a unique view of the area below as they ascend the staircase. Stepping onto the edge of the glass platform will automatically initiate the encounter sequence and <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">battle</a>. Should Arceus be defeated rather than caught, it will "disappear from sight" but the Azure Flute can be reused to summon it again.</p><p>In terms of game mechanics, when the player accesses the Hall of Origin by blowing the Azure Flute, they are actually no longer on the Spear Pillar but rather in a completely separate location, as evidenced by the screen fade-out transition and the change in location header. That is, the game does not place stair tiles onto the Spear Pillar map, but rather warps the player to a new map containing the stairs where the surrounding area looks identical to the Spear Pillar, exactly down to the cave opening that still leads into the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Mt. Coronet">mountain interior</a>. This dispels a rumor that <a href=# title=Cheating>cheating</a> to reach the Hall of Origin would trap the player on the elevated glass platform without the stairs to lead back down.</p><p>Like the Spear Pillar, the Hall of Origin is an internal area separate from <a href=# title="Mount Coronet">Mount Coronet</a>, so the <a href=# title="Escape Rope">Escape Rope</a> as well as <a href=# title="Fly (move)">Fly</a> cannot be used to leave the location. However, like the Spear Pillar, it is within the range of Mount Coronet's <a href=# title="Special magnetic field">special magnetic field</a> and so <a href=# title="Magneton (Pokémon)">Magneton</a> and <a href=# title="Nosepass (Pokémon)">Nosepass</a> will both <a href=# title=Evolution>evolve</a> here if <a href=# title=Level>leveled up</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_VIII>Generation VIII</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/ff/Stairway_of_Hall_of_Origin_LA.png/330px-Stairway_of_Hall_of_Origin_LA.png decoding=async width=220 height=124 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a>, the location can be visited legitimately. To obtain the Azure Flute, the player must possess <a href=# title="Pokémon Legends: Arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> <a href=# title="Save data bonus">save data</a> with all the <a href=# title=Task>Missions</a> completed, update the game to Version 1.3.0 or later, and be registered into the <a href=# title="Hall of Fame">Hall of Fame</a>. Once these conditions have been fulfilled, the Azure Flute will appear in the <a href=# title="Player's house">player's room</a> in <a href=# title="Twinleaf Town">Twinleaf Town</a>. After the player catches Dialga or Palkia, and also obtains the <a href=# title="National Pokédex">National Pokédex</a>, they can play the flute at the Spear Pillar to access the Hall of Origin.</p><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Legends: Arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, after defeating <a href=# title=Volo>Volo</a> and <a href=# title="Giratina (Pokémon)">Giratina</a> in Mission 26: "Seeking the Remaining Plates", the player will obtain the final <a href=# title=Plate>Plate</a> as well as the Azure Flute. The player then has the opportunity to play the Azure Flute on the <a href=# title="Temple of Sinnoh">Temple of Sinnoh</a>'s dais at any time. However, the stairs to the Hall of Origin will not appear until the player has caught every non-Mythical Pokémon in <a href=# title=Hisui>Hisui</a>. The player will also receive a message from <a href=# title="Arceus (game)">Arceus</a> on the <a href=# title="Arc Phone">Arc Phone</a> if they attempt to do so, repeating the message, "Seek out all Pokémon."</p><p>Once the player has caught all non-Mythical Pokémon in Hisui, playing the flute will cause a glowing stairway to appear on the north side of the temple, which the player will automatically climb. After climbing the stairs, the player will find themselves in the Hall of Origin, which has a completely different design than in <a href=# title="Generation IV">Generation IV</a>. Arceus will appear behind the player, transform their Arc Phone into <a href=# title="Mysterious Balm">Mysterious Balms</a>, and immediately challenge them to battle. The player can revisit the Hall of Origin at any point through Temple of Sinnoh to have a rematch with Arceus, and can also visit it for Arceus's <a href=# title="Eternal Battle Reverie">Eternal Battle Reverie</a> challenge by going to sleep at <a href=# title="Jubilife Village">Jubilife Village</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Items>Items</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Special_encounters>Special encounters</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_IV_2>Generation IV</span></h3><table align=center><tbody readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.<br>Reason: respawn conditions for DP</td></tr></tbody></table><p>An <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a> is coded to appear here, but was never made accessible.

The "fake" Hall of Origin uses <i><a href=# title="Pokémon Diamond & Pokémon Pearl: Super Music Collection">Spear Pillar</a></i> as its theme and can be accessed through the <a href=# title=Tweaking>void glitch</a> using "Stickyman's Spear Pillar Hall of Origin" method,<a href=#>[1]</a> named after its discoverer.

(<a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>YouTube video</a>)</li><li>Unlike <a href=# title="Darkrai (Pokémon)">Darkrai</a> and <a href=# title="Shaymin (Pokémon)">Shaymin</a>, simply obtaining access to the (real) Hall of Origin (e.g. through the void glitch) does not mean that the player can battle <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a> there. This is because the scripts in the area are normally programmed to only trigger through the <a href=# title="Azure Flute">Azure Flute</a> script in the <a href=# title="Spear Pillar">Spear Pillar</a>. The player can ascend the stairs, but the script to uniquely tilt and zoom the camera will not activate, nor will the script to have Arceus challenge the player when they step onto the glass platform. The Arceus sprite still appears, but just as in the actual event, it cannot be directly interacted with. Additionally in <a href=# title="Pokémon Platinum Version">Pokémon Platinum</a>, as with Darkrai and Shaymin, the Arceus sprite will not appear in the area at all unless the player has the Azure Flute in the <a href=# title=Bag>Bag</a>.
