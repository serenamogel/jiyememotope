They’re baked instead of fried (snooze), usually paired with dips that skew healthy (give me french onion dip or give me death), and have the sex appeal of Garrison Keillor singing about rhubarb pies (no shame if that’s your thing). Even in its chip form, pita bread has amazing depth of flavor and the good brands know how to accentuate that. Plus, pita chips are crunchy. For this taste test, we set out to find the ones that are as delicious as they are loud as hell.</p><p>Now, there’s a brand that sort of has the pita chip market cornered in this, the year of our lord 2022, and that’s Stacy’s. Yes, there are plenty of other brands making pita chips, but few have achieved Stacy’s level of snack-table ubiquity. I’m here to tell you that’s for a reason; the brand made a very good showing on this list. We were looking for pita chips that are flavorful and lean into their inherent bready goodness, that are crispy without being dry, and crunchy without being so thick they take out a tooth. There’s so much good stuff on this list.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Here’s the thing: These pita chips are sexy. There’s no butter in the ingredients list, but they taste so buttery. There’s no garlic listed either either, but I swear they have a hint of that savory goodness. And the richness of their baked flavor is completely addictive. Some of the chips are thin and some are thicker (body positivity win, or something) and some are more done than others, kind of like a good box of Cheez-Its. That makes for a surprising amount of variety in taste and texture for a plain chip. I really can’t say enough about how much flavor these have—I jotted down in my notes that they taste like a full dinner. If you’re looking for a pita chip that doesn’t come coated in a seasoning, I don’t think you can do better than Stacy’s in the buff. Nude, if you will.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Parmesan</p><strong>Stacy’s Parmesan Garlic & Herb Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Okay, I just went awf about how excellent Stacy’s Simply Naked chips are, but these are practically perfect too. When you see a chip is parmesan flavored, you probably expect a powdery parm coating, right? Well, these babies have parmesan cheese baked right in and the toasty, cheesy, flavor that results is outrageously good. One of my favorite foods on Earth is the Texas toast they serve at Sizzler (sue me), largely because the oily slices of mediocre bread are toasted with parmesan on top. This is tantamount to a bagful of Sizzler Texas toast, but crunchy. These chips rule.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sweet</p><strong>Stacy’s Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>It would absolutely never occur to me to buy or eat sweet pita chips (the concept of dessert hummus grosses me out for some reason), but I may be a convert now that I’ve tried these sugary guys. Even though pita chips aren’t inherently sweet, there’s enough cinnamon-sugar coating on these to make them a totally convincing sweet treat. Sporked producer-editor Madi Price thought they tasted like dehydrated cinnamon doughnuts, and, obviously, there’s a definite churros vibe. I don’t need them. I never necessarily wanted them. But I love these chips.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Herb Flavor</p><strong>Stacy’s Rosemary & Garlic Organic Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Stacy’s makes the list yet again with a pita chip that is packed with woody, herby flavor. As the bag says, rosemary is baked into these chips and it makes them so much more palatable than chips with rosemary seasoning on the outside. You can see bits of rosemary in the chips and the smell smacks you in the face (in a good way) the second you open the bag. These would be excellent with hummus, naturally, but these would also be great with a cheese dip, something super salty and savory to go with the elevated taste of the rosemary (I’m thinking a port wine cheese that comes in a plastic tub, because I’m classy like that).</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Garlic Flavor</p><strong>365 Garlic & Herb Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>If you love garlic, you’re going to love the bold garlic flavoring on these pita chips from Whole Foods. These are thicker and denser than our queen Stacy’s chips, which isn’t my personal preference, but you’ll barely worry about the texture when you have straight-up granulated garlic sizzling your buds. Beware bringing these to a party—they will straight up make your breath stink, but at home on the couch with your cat (who also happens to have terrible breath) you’re going to have a hard time putting these down. Go hard and pair them with that Sabra hummus with the puddle of oil and minced garlic in the center. Just keep your mouth shut in our presence!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_06.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Parm (Runner Up)</p><strong>Specially Selected Parmesan Garlic & Herb</strong> <strong>Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I always love to see Aldi enter the chat with an above-average product, and that’s what these are. If for some reason delicious baked-in parmesan cheese isn’t your jam, forgo the Stacy’s Parmesan Garlic & Herb and give these a shot. The parm flavor here is coming from the powdered seasoning on the chips rather than from within the chips, and if you like grated parm, you’ll really like the bold, salty, nutty taste of the parm in this bag. They reminded me of going to a good red-sauce Italian joint and being a little too liberal with the contents of the bowl of grated parm on the table. So they’re cheesy, yes, but there’s lots of other good seasoning going on here too. They pack all the flavor of good seasoned croutons, which are among <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my favorite snacks</a>.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pita chips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-PITA-CHIP_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sea Salt</p><strong>Specially Selected Sea Salt Pita Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I praised Stacy’s Naked chips for being so oily they basically taste of butter, but it occurs to me that some people might want a drier, less indulgent seeming plain pita chip. These Sea Salt chips from Aldi are an excellent option. They’re not so dry that chewing them is a chore (there’s nothing worse than groping around for some water when you’re just trying to have a snack). Honestly, they could use a little more salt for my taste too, but the chips themselves have a fresh, toasty flavor that’s extremely enjoyable. As it should be, these are like good pita bread in chip form.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Cedar’s Plain Baked Pita Chips, Trader Joe’s Sea Salt Pita Chips, Open Nature Sea Salt Pita Chips, Stacy’s Sea Salt Pita Thins, Stacy’s Multigrain Pita Chips, Stacy’s Five Cheese Pita Thins, Open Nature Parmesan Garlic Herb Pita Chips, Brewer’s Baked Pita Chips</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMitmGabmJ69tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-karl-lagerfeld.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Karl Lagerfeld?
