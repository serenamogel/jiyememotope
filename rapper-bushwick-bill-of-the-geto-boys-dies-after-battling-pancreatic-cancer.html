A member of the veteran Houston rap trio Geto Boys, Bill had revealed last month that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/880baab6-e795-4ea9-b23b-8d65b2b3a488.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, Bill’s publicist, Dawn P, that the rapper died Sunday at 9:35 p.m., local time, at a Colorado hospital. The publicist also said that the rapper, whose legal name is Richard Shaw, was surrounded by family when he died. The rapper's son, Javon, told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>&nbsp; that Bill's final words were, "I will love you forever."</p><p>The news of his death began circulating early Sunday after fellow Geto Boy Scarface posted on Instagram saying: "RIP Bushwick Bill. You will be missed big fella." Soon his daughter and his publicist slammed the reports of his death saying that he was still 'fighting for his life'.&nbsp;She said on Instagram, "Certain people have been so quick to write him off as dead so they can capitalize off it."&nbsp;She stressed, "There is no Geto Boys without Bushwick Bill."</p><p>Bill's publicist also insisted that the rapper was still alive and was on a ventilator at a Colorado hospital. But the same publicist confirmed that he died at 9:35 p.m. CST. Pete Marrero, Bill’s Dallas-based business manager, said he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in February and was not expected to recover.</p><p>The Jamaican-born rapper, while speaking about his illness, had said: "I figure keeping it myself is not really helping nobody, and I’m not really afraid of dying because if anyone knows anything about me from [his 1992 song] ‘Ever So Clear,’ I died and came back already in June 1991, so I know what it’s like on the other side." He was referring to the time he accidentally shot himself in the eye while tussling with his girlfriend over a gun. He had been planning to go on tour around the time he was hospitalized.</p><p>Bill was born with dwarfism and joined the Geto Boys in 1986, after performing as the group’s dancer. He is a founding member of Geto Boys.&nbsp; Bushwick Bill, Scarface and Willie D became the Geto Boys in Houston back in 1988 and signed with J. Prince's Rap-A-Lot Records.&nbsp;</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the trio was planning a reunion but plans fells through at the last minute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGlvaa%2BjJusrKCnnrCsecGio6Vln5t6tbTEZp6erJ9ir7DF0mabop2jYq6nwMSrZJuZpKm5qrrGZqeappOnsqLAyJxknJmemLKz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-brockman.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Brockman Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Story</span></a>
