As a fan of Spider Gang, I have always been intrigued by the deep and thought-provoking lyrics in their songs. One particular track that has caught my attention is “INTRO”.

However, with the right strategy and a few gunpowder kegs, defeating Briggsy is possible for any crew! Early reports seem to indicate the Briggsy fight scales with crew numbers. Solo players will have to deal with a Briggsy with less health while a full galleon will have a very health-heavy Briggsy to defeat. How long does it take to beat Briggsy?
