<a href=../../../../the-galaxy-s9-review.html></a>
Display Evaluation & Power The displays of the Galaxy S9’s don’t change much compared to the Galaxy S8’s. The S9 uses an upgraded AMOLED DDIC S6E3HA8 instead of last year’s S6E3HA6. The new panels are AMB577PX01 on the Galaxy S9 and an AMB622NP01 on the Galaxy S9+.
A nice addition with Samsung’s Android 8.0 OS on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 is the ability have fine-grained control over colour temperature – although it’s disappointing to see that this is limited to the Adaptive Display colour mode.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ellie Parker movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2005)</h2><time>Feb 15, 2024</time>

It is about auditioning for an idiotic Southern Gothic soap opera and then changing your makeup and accent in the car on your way to audition as a hooker in a soft-core sex film. About trying to impress a group of "producers" who are so stoned they don't have a sober brain cell to pass from hand to hand around the room.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kahlil Gibran - The Prophet, Quotes &amp;amp; Books</h2><time>Feb 15, 2024</time>
