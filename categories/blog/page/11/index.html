Marvel Cinematic Universe fans heard the name White Wolf during the post-credits scene of the first Black Panther film, when children in a Wakandan village called Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) “White Wolf.” While comic book fans recognized the term, others wondered what it meant for the character they knew as the Winter Soldier and the MCU as a whole. Five years – and 24 projects – later and fans still don’t know how Bucky earned this nickname, but we do know where the name originated in the comics and how the White Wolf could possibly feature in the third installment of the Black Panther franchise.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cinnamon Apple Scones</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
