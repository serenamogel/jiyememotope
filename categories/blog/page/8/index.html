‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äôs‚Äù Tournament of Champions has a bigger problem on its hands than trivia this year. Starting with a Reddit post made on Friday by 13-time ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù winner Ray Lalonde, several prominent contestants have pledged not to return to the series to compete in the Tournament of Champions in solidarity with the Writers Guild of America, as the series employs WGA members.
