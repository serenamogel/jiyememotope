In and Around the BitFenix Prodigy
You could be forgiven for mistaking the BitFenix Prodigy for a tiny plastic-and-steel Mac Pro tower. The Prodigy isn't quite as small as some Mini-ITX cases are, but it's still a remarkably wee enclosure for the expandability it provides.
The front of the Prodigy is entirely plastic mesh except for the BitFenix logo, including the shield for the single external 5.25" bay. It's a clean design, but given the soft plastic handles and supports of the enclosure (more on those in a second), it means that the power button, LEDs, and I/O cluster had to go somewhere else.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kristen Songer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>

Scanners A parable about film criticism andintelligence analysis from AMC's Rubicon Jim Emerson &nbsp;|&nbsp; 2010-08-18 So far (four episodes in) I am enjoying AMC's Sunday night "Mad Men" companion, "Rubicon," the "seductive conspiracy thriller," as the ads say. What I like most about it is its "Twin Peaks"-like snail's pace (a two-chord repetition in the score echoes Angelo Badalamenti's) when it comes to unraveling the central mystery, which has something to do with crossword puzzles and four-leaf clovers and suicide and murder/accidents and sets of characters who haven't even met each other yet.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nick Stahl Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>
