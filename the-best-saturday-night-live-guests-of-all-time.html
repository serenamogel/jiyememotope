A negative interaction with Chevy Chase became the basis of instant classic sketch “Word Association”, while a parody of classic horror film The Exorcist also became a thing of SNL lore.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Steve Martin</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>Having hosted fifteen episodes since Saturday Night Live‘s second season in 1976, comedy legend Steve Martin, along with Dan Aykroyd, helped create one of the early cast’s most popular recurring sketches, “The Wild and Crazy Guys”. Martin’s character was so popular, he ended up naming one of his standup albums after it. Martin has continued to host and drop in for unannounced guest appearances on SNL through the decades. His 1991 opening dance number “Not Gonna Phone It In Tonight” remains the gold standard of SNL cold opens.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Tom Hanks</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Guest-hosting Saturday Night Live since the 1980s, Tom Hanks was one of the first members of the shows “Five Timers Club”.

Pumpkins in “Haunted Elevator.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Alec Baldwin</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>Currently holding the record as a 17-time guest host on Saturday Night Live, Alec Baldwin remains popular with SNL’s audiences, as well as its cast and writers. Baldwin spent five years playing former President Donald Trump, as well as Scoutmaster Armstrong in the infamous Adam Sandler sketch “Canteen Boy”, and the more popular Pete Schwetty in “Schwetty Balls.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>John Goodman</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>The beloved John Goodman has hosted Saturday Night Live a dozen times and truly has become a member the SNL family, portraying the Church Lady’s mother in a sketch, as well as one of the Blues Brothers in the film flop Blues Brothers 2000.

Wendt is often listed a favorite guest by writers and cast members alike, due to his willingness to jump into any sketch and play any kind of character. Wendt also starred in a long-running series of extremely popular “Bill Swerski Super Fans” sketches.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Eddie Murphy</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Eddie Murphy skyrocketed to fame at the age of 20 as a cast member of Saturday Night Live in the early 1980s. Murphy also filled in as a guest host in 1984 when his 48 Hrs. co-star Nick Nolte cancelled at the last minute. Murphy wasn’t long for SNL after that, and it took him decades to return in a stellar 2019 appearance that proved he hadn’t missed a beat.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Buck Henry</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Writer/actor Buck Henry was popular among the writing staff of the first five seasons of Saturday Night Live because he was willing to do sketches that no other guest hosts were willing to take on, including a funny-because-it’s-disturbing series of sketches about creepy Uncle Roy. Henry’s anything-goes spirit is evidenced with the joy he takes in performing in this offensive SNL classic “Lord and Lady Douchebag.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Christopher Walken</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=835 data-injectable=false>Christopher Walken might not seem to be the most obvious choice to round out a list of sketch comedy greats, seeing as how he does the opposite of disappearing into character, yet the writers from all eras of Saturday Night Livr have been able to tap into his eerie off-centered dead-eyed charm. Some of Walken’s best sketches have included “The Continental,” Tina Fey’s great “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Census</a>,” and of course, playing producer Bruce Dickinson in the stone-cold classic “More Cowbell” sketch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGLAosDUq5uasV2jtqi002ajoq6VYrS2sdKtqmanlmKurbiMraCmnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwayne-johnson-height.html><span>←</span><span>Dwayne Johnson Height: How Tall is The Rock?</span></a>
