The six-episode show is based on the life of Griselda Blanco, a real-life drug trafficker and murderer who ran a cocaine cartel in the 1970s and ’80s. Her criminal prowess and viciousness earned her the nicknames “Godmother of Cocaine” and “Black Widow.” Vergara is known for her comedic chops on Modern Family and for judging America’s Got Talent, so the show offered her the chance to portray a complex and dark character.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 title="Who Was Griselda Blanco?" data-anchor-id=who-was-griselda-blanco class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Who Was Griselda Blanco?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Griselda Blanco engaged in criminal activity at an early age in her native Colombia and eventually built a drug trafficking empire in the United States. Blanco’s street smarts and ruthless streak—she’s connected to as many as hundreds of murders, including her husbands—helped her distribute cocaine from Miami to southern California in the 1970s and ’80s. Her criminal enterprise garnered her such nicknames as the “Queen of Cocaine” and “Godmother of Cocaine.” Following years of investigations, Blanco was arrested by federal agents in 1985 and spent nearly two decades in prison on drug trafficking and murder charges. At age 69, she was gunned down in 2012 back in Colombia.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Griselda Blanco Restrepo<br>BORN: February 15, 1943<br>DIED: September 3, 2012<br>BIRTHPLACE: Cartagena, Colombia<br>SPOUSES: Carlos Trujillo, Alberto Bravo, and Dario Sepulveda<br>CHILDREN: Dixon, Uber, Osvaldo, and Michael Corleone<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Younger Years" data-anchor-id=younger-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Younger Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Griselda Blanco Restrepo was born on February 15, 1943, in Colombia. Many sources cite her birth city as Cartagena, whereas others report it was Santa Marta. Her mother was reportedly an alcoholic sex worker who relocated to Medellín when Blanco was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/griselda-blanco-poverty-to-wealth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="around 3" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">around 3</a>. The young girl might have been abused by her mother’s clients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco turned to a life of crime at a young age. When she was 11, she purportedly helped kidnap a 10-year-old boy from a wealthy family in the Medellín area. When the family wouldn’t pay his ransom, Blanco allegedly shot the abducted child. She also reportedly became a pickpocket and sex worker.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="Becoming The “Queen of Cocaine”" data-anchor-id=becoming-the-queen-of-cocaine class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Becoming The “Queen of Cocaine”</h2><img alt="griselda blanco lies on her side and looks at the camera, she wears a black and white striped dress in a room with several flower bouquets" title="Griselda Blanco" width=1931 height=1331 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2jk2p6r-65665967b9947.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Alamy</span><p>Griselda Blanco lived a lavish lifestyle after building up a large cocaine trafficking operation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco’s second husband, Albert Bravo, was a drug trafficker who introduced Blanco to the trade. She initially trafficked marijuana but soon switched to cocaine, which was easier to transport. Blanco had female couriers wear bras and girdles with special pockets to secretly carry the drug into the United States.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco’s success in helping to distribute Colombian cocaine in New York City drew attention from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). In April 1975, Blanco and more than 30 of her partners were indicted on federal drug conspiracy charges as part of a wide-ranging investigation termed Operation Banshee. However, Blanco escaped arrest because she had fled to Colombia.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Infamous Drug Traffickers</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the late 1970s, Blanco was in Miami. She established a massive narcotics ring that at its height was reportedly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article1942420.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trafficking 3,400 pounds of cocaine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">trafficking 3,400 pounds of cocaine</a> each month. She also turned to violence to ensure her dominance as a drug kingpin. Blanco would eliminate people to avoid paying them money she owed, or because they owed her money, or if she felt they had disrespected her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco is credited with fine-tuning the murder method of having hired killers commit drive-by shootings on motorcycles, which made it easy for the assassins to vanish from the scene. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=sxjOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to the 2014 book Drugs in American Society" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to the 2014 book Drugs in American Society</a>, she was responsible for most of South Florida’s murders from 1979 to 1981. She was also behind the 1982 death of a 2-year-old who was an accidental casualty in her attempted takedown of a rival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">People began to use nicknames like “La Madrina (the godmother),” “Cocaine Queen,” “Godmother of Cocaine,” and “Queen of Cocaine” to refer to Blanco. She eluded law enforcement for years as she dyed her hair, lost or gained weight, or used one of multiple aliases. The DEA finally tracked Blanco down after she moved to California in 1984. In February 1985, she was arrested in Irvine, a city south of Los Angeles.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 title="Conviction and Prison" data-anchor-id=conviction-and-prison class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Conviction and Prison</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco’s trial, which took place in New York in June and July of 1985, ended with a conviction on one count of conspiracy to manufacture, import into the United States, and distribute cocaine. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison. At one point during her incarceration, she allegedly planned for associates to kidnap <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/john-f-kennedy-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F.

She risked the death penalty, but the case against her derailed due to a strange turn of events. The prosecution’s star witness, a former hitman for Blanco named Jorge “Rivi” Ayala, had phone sex with secretaries in the state attorney’s office. Prosecutors ended up offering Blanco a deal, and in 1998, she pleaded guilty to three second-degree murder charges. She was released from prison in June 2004 and deported back to Colombia.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=25 title="Net Worth" data-anchor-id=net-worth class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Net Worth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the height of Blanco’s trafficking success, she had a net income of $80 million per month. It’s estimated her net worth climbed as high as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/richest-criminals/griselda-blanco-net-worth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$2 billion" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">$2 billion</a>. She had a mansion in Miami and flew on a private jet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco didn’t maintain a similarly luxurious lifestyle when she returned to Colombia following her time in prison. However, she still lived in an upscale gated community and had real estate holdings when she died.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 title="Husbands and Sons" data-anchor-id=husbands-and-sons class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Husbands and Sons</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco was married three times and had four sons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her first husband was Carlos Trujillo, a forger. She had three sons with Trujillo: Dixon, Uber, and Osvaldo. Although they divorced in the late 1960s, Blanco is suspected of ordering Trujillo’s death in the early 1970s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After they worked together as drug traffickers, Blanco killed her second husband, Alberto Bravo, in a shootout outside Bogotá, Colombia, in 1975. She had suspected that Bravo had been stealing from her. This resulted in another Blanco nickname: “Black Widow.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her third husband, Dario Sepulveda, Blanco had one more son: Michael Corleone. He was named after a character from The Godfather, portrayed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/al-pacino data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Al Pacino" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Al Pacino</a> in the Godfather movies. In 1983, Sepulveda was killed in Medellín by men pretending to be police officers. Blanco was also suspected of ordering his death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Blanco’s three oldest sons followed in her footsteps. Dixon, Uber, and Osvaldo worked as drug traffickers, and all three were sent to federal prison around the same time as their mother. After being released from prison, they returned to Colombia. Uber and Osvaldo were both killed there, as Griselda would be in 2012.

According to reports, a gunman on a motorbike shot Blanco after she exited a butcher shop. This was an echo of the drive-by murder method that she had used to take control of the drug trade in Miami.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Blanco’s death, some authorities estimated she was responsible for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2012/09/04/world/americas/colombia-elderly-ex-trafficker-killed/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="40 murders" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">40 murders</a>.

She was profiled in Richard Smitten’s 1990 book The Godmother and was prominently featured in Billy Corben’s 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, as well as its 2008 sequel, Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin’ with the Godmother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, HBO announced it was developing a film about Blanco’s life, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jennifer-lopez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Lopez " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jennifer Lopez </a>attached to star.
