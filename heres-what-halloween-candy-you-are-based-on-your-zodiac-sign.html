No source for that one, just speaking from personal experience. But not everyone’s candy go-to’s are the same, just like not every person is the same. And since there is so much variety in both, we are here to tell you what candy you are based on your zodiac sign so that this Halloween you can not only eat your favorite candy, but also the candy that fits you best based on your sign (and if those two candies happen to be the same, please let us know how magical we are in the comments).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aries-march-21-april-19-kit-kat>Aries (<strong>March 21-April 19</strong>): <a href=# rel=noopener>Kit Kat</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-ARIES-1170x658.jpg><p>Kit Kats are a klassic. It is actually difficult to find a person who dislikes Kit Kats. People either love them, really love them, or “wouldn’t say no if you offered them one.” Aries are the same way—people love to love ‘em, they make great leaders, and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who hates them.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The Best Chocolate Halloween Candy for Spooky Season</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taurus (April 20-May 20):&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Milky Way</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-TAURUS-1170x658.jpg><p>What is the smoothest, dreamiest Halloween-ready chocolate bar? It is Milky Way, of course. And with their calming, soft and smooth texture, they are the perfect match for Tauruses, who have a soothing, calming, soft presence. Both Tauruses and Milky Way bars have a way of diffusing any situation, and that is why they are the perfect match.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The Best Chocolate Halloween Candy for Spooky Season</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gemini (May 21-June 20): <a href=# rel=noopener>Lemonheads</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-GEMINI-1170x658.jpg><p>Lemonheads are both sweet and sour. They have those two very distinct attributes, but that is also what makes them so great! The same is true for Geminis—they may have two distinct sides to their personality, but the combination of the two is what makes them such cool people. Some people think that makes Geminis two-faced, but the reality is that Geminis are fun, chaotic, and interesting. Geminis contain multitudes, you guys. Deal with it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cancer (June 21-July 22): <a href=# rel=noopener>M&M’s</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-CANCER-1170x658.jpg><p>These days there are a lot of different flavors of M&M’s. There are so many that you can’t really know what flavor the M&M’s are just by looking at them. The same goes for Cancers. The first time you meet a Cancer, you may think, “Hmmm, they were pleasant and all, but I feel like I still know nothing about them.” Then, once you actually crack through their emotional outer shell and get to know them, you will find they are some of the most fascinating people you will ever meet. Now are they as fascinating as Jalapeño Peanut M&M’s were back when they came out? Debatable. But Cancers and M&M’s will both surprise you so give them a chance this Halloween.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The 7 Best M&M’s Flavors</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Leo (July 23-August 22): <a href=# rel=noopener>Reese’s Pumpkins</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-LEO-1170x658.jpg><p>Reese’s Pumpkins are one of the most well-known, well-liked specific-to-Halloween candies out there. People love them. Their ratio of PB to Chocolate is better than the other Reese’s. Basically, people feel that these seasonal Reese’s are unique and special. This is similar to Leos, whose friends know how special they are and will sing their praises all year round. Plus, Leos always have that main character energy of “not being like the other girls,” so to speak, and so do Reese’s Pumpkins. They are certainly not like the other Reese’s. But that is why we love ‘em.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The Best Chocolate Halloween Candy for Spooky Season</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Virgo (August 23-September 22):&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dubble Bubble</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-VIRGO-1170x658.jpg><p>Virgos are very busy people, and this is one of the best candies for when you want to be doing something else while enjoying your Halloween candy haul. Plus, not only is gum not distracting in the same way some melty chocolate bar would be, it also helps you focus—exactly what a busy Virgo needs in their life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Libra (September 23-October 22): <a href=# rel=noopener>Sour Skittles</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-LIBRA-1170x658.jpg><p>Libras love when everything is harmonious. Enter Sour Skittles, the perfect balance of crunchy, chewy, sour, and sweet. Libras tend to be some of the most complex people while still remaining down-to-earth and genuine. Sour Skittles are the same way—complex, balanced, and multifaceted, but still an accessible candy you can pick up at any CVS.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>An Updated Ranking of the Best Sour Candy</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Scorpio (October 23-November 21): <a href=# rel=noopener>Whoppers</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-SCORPIO-1170x658.jpg><p>Scorpios are mysterious people and, for my money, there is no candy more mysterious than Whoppers. What even are they? What are milk balls? What is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">malt</a>? I want answers. We all want answers</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21):&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Smarties</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-SAG-1170x658.jpg><p>Sagittariuses are extremely curious about the world around them (for instance, if anyone knows what malted milk balls are, it’s them). And you know what curious people often are? Smarties. Am I basing this one on a pun? Yes. Does that make it any less accurate? No, ma’am.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Capricorn (December 22-January 19): <a href=# rel=noopener>Tootsie Pops</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-CAPRICORN-1170x658.jpg><p>Capricorns are the most patient of the signs. You know what else takes patience? Getting to the center of a Tootsie Pop (that is unless you are a certain cartoon owl who bites into lollipops like a maniac). My point is, if anyone can get to the center of a Tootsie pop the right way (licking it like a normal, non-cartoon-owl person), it is Capricorns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aquarius (January 20-February 18): <a href=# rel=noopener>Nerds</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-AQUARIUS-1170x658.jpg><p>Aquariuses are unique and innovative, and I defy you to find any other candy that reminds you at all of Nerds candy. Betcha can’t. That is because Nerds candy, like Aquariuses, is very much its own thing, and it is not apologizing for it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pisces (February 19-March 20): <a href=# rel=noopener>Sour Patch Kids</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZODIAC_HALLOWEEN_ARTICLE-PISCES-1170x658.jpg><p>Pisces love whimsy and nostalgia and there are fewer things more nostalgic than those tiny packs of Sour Patch Kids. Even though I usually optimized for quantity in the big post-trick-or-treating candy trading sessions I had with my brother growing up, I made an exception for these—one of the best-tasting chewy fruity candies out there—even though only five came in a pack. It is tough to find someone who doesn’t have a fond memory of Sour Patch Kids, the same way it is tough to find a person without a fond memory of a Pisces friend.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>An Updated Ranking of the Best Sour Candy</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKCVp7K0edahmK1lmJa5rbvWnpynZZOWu6XFjLKmrmWRp7JursCsnJ1ln6N6urvUq2Szp5SerqR50qKep2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brendan-schaub-is-not-married-to-wife-dating-girlfriend-joanna-zanella-544618-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brendan Schaub is not Married to Wife.
