The game got near-perfect scores across the board with <a href=#>reviewers</a> because they absolutely loved the game. There is a lot of content packed into the game, so fans are always discovering something new.</p><p>One of the biggest pieces of content that was a well-kept secret was The Depths, an underground area for Tears of the Kingdom. The Depths were not in <a href=#>Breath of the Wild</a>, so players are exploring it on their own time. The Depths has Lightroots that are very useful for the players exploring the underground area. Here, we will go over <strong>how many Lightroots are in The Depths in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/rleeNmSEV2Cedq4mS4NpZnaS8WcJhp7mBnPhxpH1O3Q/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9aZWxkYS90ZWFyc29mdGhla2luZ2RvbS9MaWdodHJvb3QvemVsZGFfdGVhcnNfb2ZfdGhlX2tpbmdkb21fbGlnaHRyb290XzNfc2l6ZS5wbmc><h2 id=mcetoc_1h19qrs7d2><strong>How Many Lightroots Are In Tears Of The Kingdom?</strong></h2><p>Not only is there a brand new sky area to explore in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a> with <a href=#>Sky Islands</a>, but there is a massive underground system called <a href=#>The Depths</a> as well. In The Depths, it is extremely dark and it is difficult to see. But <strong>to light up The Depths, you need to find the Lightroots</strong> that are around you. So finding as many Lightroots as possible is beneficial to your adventure.</p><p>But how many Lightroots are in The Depths anyways? There are <strong>a total of 120 Lightroots in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. Each Lightroot fills the surrounding area with light allowing you to see where you are going. With that in mind, that many Lightroots mean that The Depths is absolutely massive, so it is worth getting the Lightroots so you can see.</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1h19qrs7d3><strong>Is It Worth Finding All The Lightroots In Tears of The Kingdom?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/BKTphcdC463RWu_cZyCObigKeqM6FKUWTi1zPa2jBiQ/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9aZWxkYS90ZWFyc29mdGhla2luZ2RvbS9MaWdodHJvb3QvemVsZGFfdGVhcnNfb2ZfdGhlX2tpbmdkb21fbGlnaHRyb290XzJfc2l6ZS5wbmc><p>We would say yes, <strong>it is worth getting all the Lightroots in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. One of the main reasons why is that The Depths are massive and the ability to see incoming enemies is crucial. Especially since it is hard to get resources in The Depths. You also can use Lightroots to heal yourself from <a href=#>Gloom</a> which you cannot get rid of without a Sunny meal or returning to the surface.</p><p>But not only that, you will get a special reward for finding all of the Lightroots as well. If you<strong> find every Lightroot in Tears of the Kingdom, you will get the Dispelling Darkness Medal</strong>. This medal is shaped like a Lightroot and will go into your key items. The item does not do anything, but it is a nice marker of your achievement.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2qTcliBkdQ2tt-IwTfnfNqnLcqX9oyo7hz8UfmwTOtk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9kYW5pZWxfYm9yamFzLmpwZw alt="Daniel Borjas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3DGxKWbmmWkmq6zv4yonWasmJp6rLXNoJuopV%2Bhtqi002apqKekqHqpu9ZmpJqmqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bernie-clifton-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bernie Clifton Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
