And if hearing the words “a Jar Jar toy” isn’t horrifying enough, wait till you see what it does. According to OP, this toy only has Jar Jar’s head. And users can open it to see their tongue sticking out. Just saying, the second image looks very cursed. Who in Lucasarts approved this?</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop</a>, the toy in question is called ‘Jar Jar Binks Candy Tongue.’ It’s a candy dispenser where children “suck Jar Jar’s tongue” to get their daily dose of sugar. And yes, these were sold in your local confectionary section in the supermarket or in that one candy in your local shops.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Oddly enough, the people on Reddit jokingly thought this Star Wars toy was more than confectionery. The first thing in most fans’ minds was that it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a weird-looking Star Wars fleshlight</a>. One joked about how this toy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taught children how to French kiss</a>, which prompted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tucker Carlson joke to follow.</a> You do you, internet. If you all have a hidden alien fetish, there is no shame.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Star Wars has a history of releasing strange and sometimes horrifying merchandise in the past. In 1982, a C3PO tape dispenser was released, which looked very questionable the more you look at it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The C-3PO tape dispenser (1982) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mjY8LINus7</a></p>— crazy ass moments in star wars history (@SW_Moment) <a href=#>August 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Fingers crossed that Disney’s purchase of Star Wars has placed the merchandise department in check. And based on the recent toy releases, nothing seems out of the ordinary just yet. But who knows, maybe one will slip through the cracks and scare the next generation of Star Wars fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tMDAq2SwmaKoeqetzWabq6eno8Butc1mpaKfmKm6or7EZp2unZyasW66zqyrmqSXnq5urcWtnKtllp67pbXNoGSjmaJit6K%2BjK2msmWkna61edKhpq6klKPBbrHXoqqtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-backhouse-astor-sr.html><span>←</span><span>William Backhouse Astor, Sr.</span></a>
