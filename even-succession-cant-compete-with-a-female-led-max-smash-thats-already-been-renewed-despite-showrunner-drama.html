After López took over from the Italian-American series creator Pizzolatto as the showrunner for Night Country, it didn’t take long for it to become the latest entry in the canon of unreasonably targeted and hated female-led projects in male-dominated spaces.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>The first season of True Detective might be worshipped among a certain best-avoided subsection of male social media users, but López’s Night Country broke all the viewership records, beating the likes of Succession, Tokyo Vice, and Young Sheldon to the top spot of Max’s most-streamed shows globally, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>. Season 4 drew in 12.7 million cross-platform viewers to become the show’s most-watched installment to date, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reported. It has spent 23 days on FlixPatrol’s Max Top 10, taking the first-place crown in over 40 countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/True-Detective-Night-Country.jpg><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Night Country stars Jodie Foster and Kali Reis as Detectives <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liz Danvers</a> and Evangeline Navarro, who investigate the disappearance of eight men from a research station in the fictional town of Ennis, Alaska. Following the first episode’s release on Jan. 14, numerous half-star and one-star reviews flooded the show’s Rotten Tomatoes page, among many other, much more positive comments, leading López to accuse haters of an attempt to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sabotage</a> her season. The excessive backlash found online despite a harmless, if imperfect, season backs the showrunner’s accusations.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leave it to a magazine that hasn’t been relevant in fifty years to get this so wrong.

Season 2, written by Pizzolatto, and largely considered the show’s weakest, sits at 47 percent.
