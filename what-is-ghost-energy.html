The company markets its creatively flavored carbonated beverages as “supercharged,” presumably because of how amped it can get you. A new product is never without its inquisitors, so we put together this handy list of frequently asked questions for these eye-catching cans of energizing elixir. Read on, if you have the…energy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-ghost-energy-drink><strong>What is Ghost energy drink?</strong></h2><p>Ghost bills itself as the “fully transparent, fully loaded, feel-good energy drink we’ve all been waiting for.” It’s a caffeinated beverage that also includes nootropics, which are, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WebMD</a>, “any natural or synthetic substance that may have a positive impact on mental skills.” There are prescription, FDA-approved nootropics out there, which treat things like ADHD or Alzheimer’s. But Ghost does not require a prescription. It comes in flavors like Swedish Fish, Sour Patch Kids, and Faze Pop. Mmm, I love faze pop season, when you can pick them right off the vine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-makes-ghost-energy-drink><strong>Who makes Ghost energy drink?</strong></h2><p>Though Ghost is an independent company, in 2020 the folks at Anheuser-Busch made a heavy investment into Ghost and now helps with distribution. This widened Ghost’s availability considerably and got the product into a larger variety of stores—almost 50% of all grocery and convenience stores <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the latest polls</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-much-caffeine-is-in-ghost-energy-drink><strong>How much caffeine is in Ghost energy drink?</strong></h2><p>Ghost energy drink contains 200mg of natural caffeine, which is about the same as a couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cups of coffee</a>. That’s a generally safe level, depending on how caffeine affects you. If you tend to go full Cornholio-mode after a couple sips of java, then maybe take it easy on the energy drinks!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-did-ghost-energy-drink-come-out><strong>When did Ghost energy drink come out?</strong></h2><p>Ghost was co-founded by Ryan Hughes, a former professional bodybuilder, with Daniel Lourenco in 2016. According to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes article</a>, they wanted to market an energy drink that had “authenticity at its core,” citing that other energy drinks advertised a fake version of fitness. I will not be making any jokes about these musclebound fellows for fear of getting stuffed in a locker or getting my underwear pulled over the top of my head in front of my crush, thank you very much for respecting this.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-ghost-energy-a-pre-workout-drink><strong>Is Ghost energy a pre-workout drink?</strong></h2><p>Well, technically anything can be a pre-workout drink if you drink it before a workout. I personally chug a gallon of Yoo-hoo before hitting spin class (until I was asked to never return after getting sick every time). But, I digress! Ghost is not formulated with ingredients that are specifically geared toward improving exercise performance. You would be better off using a product that is manufactured to be consumed before a workout…or, heck, just eating a nice light meal and hydrating with water!&nbsp;</p><p>Now, having answered these Ghost energy drink questions, I feel I must apologize to those of you who read this entire article thinking I was going to answer questions about some sort of haunted energy drink. Sorry, but I’m simply not qualified to speak about hauntings, ghouls, or any ghastly type things. Plus, let’s face facts, I’m a craven little coward when it comes to that stuff. Got a question about real ghosts? I know who you’re going to call: someone else!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmnqGno6l6prrEq56yZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newsha-syeh-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-648083-html.html><span>←</span><span>Newsha Syeh Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
