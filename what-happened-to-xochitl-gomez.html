She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, everyone. We okay.‚Äù</p><p>In the story, there was also a scene of a makeup artist covering up a bandage on Gomez‚Äôs knee with a foundation that matched her skin tone. You can see the screenshot of her story in a tweet provided below:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=# rel=noopener>#XochitlGomez</a> shows brutal extent of injuy and method to hide from <a href=# rel=noopener>#DWTS</a> viewers<a href=#>https://t.co/n71zKjlkop</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VXxbptXr7g</a></p><p>‚Äî ExpressUSNews (@ExpressUSNews) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 1, 2023</a></p><p><strong>If you want to know what happened with your other favorite stars‚Äô then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><h2>Did Gomez and Chmerkovskiy Win?</h2><p><strong>Gomez and Chmerkovskiy still managed to top the leaderboard with their number despite the injury. </strong>They got 37 out of 40 points from the three main judges and Niecy Nash-Betts, who was a guest judge. Each of the show‚Äôs key judges gave them a nine and Nash-Betts gave them a wonderful ten.</p><p>Gomez seemed fine later on during the dance marathon. She was happy to be with Chmerkovskiy and even did dance moves where she got down on one knee and spun across the floor. The dance style changed from the Hustle to the Charleston, which has a lot of knee movement and fancy steps when they got to the top four.</p><p><strong>Gomez and Chmerkovskiy won the race in the end, just beating Ariana Madix and Pasha Pashkov.</strong> They got five extra points for this, making their total 42 units. At the end of the night, Julianne Hough doused them in red confetti, like in the scary movie Carrie.</p><p>For more information related to these kinds of topics, you can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and check out our other latest posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnxxfY6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerm7wqGgraRdnLyusdlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kerry-condon-net-worth-160921.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kerry Condon Net Worth</span></a>
