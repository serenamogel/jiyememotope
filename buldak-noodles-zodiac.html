A day when we all learn that each of us is spicy in our own right, and that every person is a unique and varied flavor of spicy. You know what else has a bunch of unique and varied flavors of spicy? Samyan Buldak ramen noodles. So whether you are sassy spicy, chaotic spicy, or spicy chicken spicy, there is a Buldak noodles flavor out there that fits your personality. So without further adoodle, let’s talk spicy noodles. (Oh and if you’re curious whether you’re among the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/every-flavor-of-buldak-noodles-ranked/>best Buldak ramen flavors</a>, be sure to read our ranking.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Aries (March 21-April 19):</strong> Hot Chicken</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_header_aries-1170x658.jpg><p>This is the original Buldak flavor. The one that started it all. And if your friend group doesn’t have an inside joke or special recurring event dreamed up by an Aries who also “started it all,” then I am a monkey’s uncle. That or a bad guesser.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taurus (April 20-May 20):</strong> Quattro Cheese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_taurus-1170x658.jpg><p>This particular Buldak flavor is comforting, like eating Kraft Mac & Cheese by the fire, except that with this stuff the fire is not by you but rather in your mouth along with the Kraft Mac & Cheese flavor. This flavor comforts you but at the same time it keeps you on your toes, and if that ain’t Taurus-y, I don’t know what is.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</strong>: Habanero Lime</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_gemini-1170x658.jpg><p>“There is a lot going on here, but I am not mad about it.” – A perfect description of this ramen flavor, as well as Geminis everywhere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cancer (June 21-July 22):</strong> Cheese</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_cancer-1170x658.jpg><p>Here’s the thing about both these noodles and Cancers. You see them, you first meet them, you think they won’t be that spicy, and they might even be a little cheesy, but, SPOILER ALERT, Y’ALL: Both Cancers and these noodles are so McFrickin’ SPICY. Does the cheese cut the spice at all here? Hell no. Can you even taste the cheese over the taste of the fire in your mouth? Not at all. Much like Cancers, this flavor of Buldak keeps things interesting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Leo (July 23-August 22):</strong> Curry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_leo-1170x658.jpg><p>Can you think of a single dish that contains curry but curry is not the main event? No, you cannot. Can you think of a single outing with your Leo friends where they are not the main event? Also, no. But is curry awesome? Um, of course it is. Are your Leo friends awesome? Yes, 9.97 times out of 10. Was this a whole paragraph of me answering my own questions? That’s for you to decide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Virgo (August 23-September 22):</strong> Corn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_virgo-1170x658.jpg><p>Virgos are always doing the most, and so is this ramen flavor. Spicy corn-flavored noodles are something I never really thought about until today, and now I can’t stop thinking about them. Leave it to Virgos and this spicy corn ramen to accomplish something new, exciting, and groundbreaking that we the people didn’t even know we needed. I swear Virgos are holding this world together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Libra (September 23-October 22):</strong> Jjajang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_libra-1170x658.jpg><p>Libras are all about balance so they have to be one of the few Buldak flavors where pure spiciness isn’t the main goal. These Jjajang noodles (inspired by Korean black bean sauce noodles) are definitely still spicy (as are Libras), but these noodles also happen to have a slight sweetness to them (as do Libras), as well as a deep savoriness to balance it out. They are the “epitome of noodle harmony,” which, ironically enough, is how my Libra friend describes her own brain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Scorpio (October 23-November 21):</strong> Tomato Pasta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_scorpio-1170x658.jpg><p>This tomato pasta is a curious yet delicious mix of flavors. I don’t fully understand it, but I like that it is so unapologetically itself. And, gosh darn, if that isn’t the nature of my relationship with most of my Scorpio friends. Also, it’s a bit tough to find this one in the wild, just like sometimes it can be tough find a Scorpio in the crowd (in fact, I have decided that it is now canon that Waldo of Where’s Waldo fame is a Scorpio). These elusive noodles are very intriguing to me, so they have to go with the most intriguing of the signs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21):</strong>&nbsp;Hot Chicken Tteokbokki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_sagittarius-1170x658.jpg><p>Sagittarians are curious folks who always want to learn more about the world around them, so they strike me as being the original Buldak Hot chicken sauce Tteokbokki, akathose cylindrical Korean rice cakes. People who are in the know (and Sagittarians are almost always in the know) are aware of these rice cakes and that Buldak makes a version of them, and, y’all, these are absolutely fire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19):</strong> Kimchi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_capricorn-1170x658.jpg><p>Making kimchi takes patience. You have to wash cabbage, salt it, rinse it, drain it, mix a bunch of delicious stuff into it, pack it in containers, and then let it sit for a good long while. You know who has that kind of patience? Only Capricorns. And while I understand that this is an instant ramen and you by no means have to make your own kimchi to eat it, the fact that it is inspired by a dish that takes a bit of patience to prepare makes me think of Capricorns, the mature older siblings of the zodiac world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Aquarius (January 20-February 18):</strong> Carbonara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_aquarius-1170x658.jpg><p>This is the most unique flavor of Buldak noodles in that it is inspired by a dish that doesn’t have a super specific flavor. And yet, when you combine whatever the flavor developers over at Buldak classify as “Carbonara flavor” with that quintessential Buldak spice, it is pure magic. This flavor of Buldak is cheesy, savory, creamy, and oh-so spicy (but not so spicy it is inedible). This stuff is inventive and unique and there is nothing else like it on the instant noodle market, and that is very Aquarian of them. Both these noodles and Aquarians are not like the other girls, and we love that for them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Pisces (February 19-March 20):</strong> 2x Spicy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ZODIAC_buldak_article_pisces-1170x658.jpg><p>I mean, come on. Spicy Pisces have to have the spiciest of the noodles because, hoooo boy, do Pisces people (and these noodles) know how to keep things spicy. As the most romantic and creative of the signs, Pisces know how to turn up the heat and so do these absolutely insanely spicy noodles. Thus, I give the 2X spicy noodles to my 2X Spicy Pisces pals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqlobGit4ynpqicnJrAbsbOnaCam18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-reason-these-stars-left-disney-behind.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Reason These Stars Left Disney Behind</span></a>
