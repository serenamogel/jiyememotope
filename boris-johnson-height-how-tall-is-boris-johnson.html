Johnson has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015, and previously served as the MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008.</p><p>Born on 19 June 1964, Johnson attended Eton College and studied Classics at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1986. In 1989, he became the Brussels correspondent and later political columnist for The Daily Telegraph, and from 1999 to 2005, he was the editor of The Spectator. After his election to Parliament in 2001, he became a member of the shadow cabinets of Michael Howard and David Cameron.</p><p>In 2008, <a href=# rel=noopener>Boris Johnson</a> was elected Mayor of London and resigned from the House of Commons. He was re-elected mayor in 2012. At the 2015 general election, he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and the following year, he did not seek re-election as mayor. Johnson played a prominent role in the successful Vote Leave campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum.</p><p>After the referendum, Theresa May appointed him as Foreign Secretary in her cabinet. Boris Johnson resigned from the position two years later in protest against the Chequers Agreement and May’s approach to Brexit.</p><p>Boris Johnson defeated Jeremy Hunt in the leadership election to succeed May, who resigned after Parliament repeatedly rejected her Brexit withdrawal agreement. After becoming prime minister, Johnson re-opened Brexit negotiations and in early September prorogued Parliament, with the Supreme Court later that month ruling the action as unlawful.</p><p>After agreeing to a revised Brexit withdrawal agreement which replaced the Irish backstop with a new Northern Ireland Protocol but failing to win parliamentary support for the agreement, Boris Johnson called a snap general election in December 2019. In the election, he led the Conservative Party to its largest victory since the 1987 general election. On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU, entering into a transition period and trade negotiations that led to the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p><p>During Boris Johnson’s tenure as prime minister, a significant event was the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020. His government responded to the pandemic by introducing various emergency powers and measures across the country to mitigate its impact and approved the rollout of a nationwide vaccination programme. He also responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorising foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.</p><p>Amidst the Partygate scandal, Johnson was issued with a fixed penalty notice in April 2022. The publishing of the Sue Gray report in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a vote of confidence in his leadership among Conservative MPs, which he won.</p><p>However, in July 2022, revelations over his appointment of Chris Pincher as Deputy Chief Whip led to a mass resignation of members of his government and Johnson’s resignation. He left office on 6 September and was succeeded by Liz Truss, his Foreign Secretary. Johnson remains in the House of Commons as a backbencher.</p><p>Boris Johnson is a controversial figure in British politics. His supporters have praised him for being humorous, witty, and entertaining, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative Party voters, making him an electoral asset to the party.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Boris Johnson Height: How Tall Is Boris Johnson?</h2><p>Boris Johnson’s height is approximately 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm). However, it’s important to note that height measurements can vary slightly depending on the source and method of measurement. Some sources may list his height as 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm) or 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm), but 5 feet 9 inches is generally considered to be the most accurate.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that Boris Johnson’s weight and physical appearance have been the subject of public scrutiny in the past. He is known for his distinctive blonde hair and has been described as having a “stocky” build. However, his height is generally considered to be within the average range for a male adult in the UK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpumq6GjYrewtM2spqdlmJq2qLTTZp%2Bor12prq24jKKqZpqfp7a0ecmon6ern6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./humberly-gonzalez-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Does Humberly Gonzlez Have a Husband?
