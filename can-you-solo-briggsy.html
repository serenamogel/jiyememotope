She can be found on Cannon Cove, Discovery Ridge, Kraken's Fall, Lone Cove, Mermaid's Hideaway, Shipwreck Bay, The Crooked Masts or Wanderer's Refuge.<h2>How do you beat Briggsy?</h2>A good strategy would be to lure her in range of the ship's Cannons to kill her faster. If you're by yourself you can kill her with 5 gunpowder barrels around 5 feet. If she's too far from the kegs, won't kill her. Firebombs are also extremely effective.<h2>How to SOLO Captain Briggsy - Sea of Thieves Tall Tales</h2><p></p><h2>Does Briggsy heal?</h2>While these are her three main abilities, she can also fire her flintlock, swing her cutlass, and eat bananas to heal.<h2>What are Briggsy skulls worth?</h2>The skull is not worth any gold, and Players will only receive a gold reward for completing the Cursed Rogue Tale.<h2>Where is the key for Briggsy chest?</h2>Obtaining.
