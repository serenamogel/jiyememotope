Here was a chance for Banderas, 59, to explore and enact the inner workings of one of his oldest comrades and collaborators.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>“To find somebody who’s developed a very strong personality…and has been absolutely loyal to that personality is very rare,” the Zorro lead said of Almodóvar. “I am actually a very, very lucky person [to have] shared in that universe with him.”</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Banderas’ working and friendly relationship with the Spanish auteur stretches across 40 years and eight films, their first being 1982’s sex-crazed melodrama Labyrinth of Passion. However, their off-and-on partnership has never been more effective than in Pain and Glory, which saw Banderas walk out of Italy with its festival’s Best Actor award in hand.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/painandglory_01-564x282.jpg alt="Pain and glory" width=564 height=282 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>One of the many reasons for this performance’s success may be the wealth of valid insight at Banderas’ disposal. His character, Salvador Mallo, is the spawn of Almodóvar’s actual life. Showcasing a filmmaker on the brink of physical and mental collapse, the picture bounces between Salvador’s hazy, heroin-laced semi-retirement and flashbacks of his humble childhood alongside his mother, played by Penelope Cruz.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Another may be the distinct departure from the suave, sexy Spaniard persona Banderas’ career has, in so many instances, relied on. He and his director agreed early in the process that a “clean slate” was required for Salvador, who, with a salt-and-pepper mane and a horrendous surgical scar along his spine, never comes close to wielding a gun or saber.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>With that said, pain, as the title suggests, was not entirely absent from the production.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>“The amount of emotion that surrounded this particular movie…was unexpected for me,” the actor explained, detailing Almodóvar’s cathartic confrontations with the onscreen version of his mother. In one instance, Banderas was even fueled by the Volver creator’s inability to repeat a potent line from his own screenplay.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>“That emotional information was not planned,” he admitted. “Those are things that happen in the moment, and if you are fresh…you can work with them.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Pain-Glory-Making-Of-image-@Manolo-Pavón0813-564x318.jpg alt="pain and glory" width=564 height=318 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>In terms of motivation, Banderas had some experiences of his own, beyond Almodóvar’s, to mine inspiration. Two and a half years ago, he suffered from a heart attack that quickly put into perspective the most important things in his life, a transformation that didn’t go unnoticed by his longtime collaborator.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>“It opened my eyes to understand myself better…and Pedro saw that. He said, ‘I don’t know how to describe it, but after you had this heart attack, there is something in you. Don’t hide it. I want you to use that for the character.’”</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>“Don’t worry,” Banderas responded, “I know exactly what you’re talking about.”</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false><strong>Pain and Glory </strong>will be released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics on October 4th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKesn6O2sHnBmqWdnaKWwG6%2BxJ%2BjnpukqHqxrcinZKCkn6fGbq%2FOp6qinJWnwG61za%2Bmpa6VorKvwIyhpqenomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-roman-colosseum-tourist-ivan-dimitrov-search-underway-for-man-accused-of-defacing-historic-amphitheatre.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Roman Colosseum tourist Ivan Dimitrov?
