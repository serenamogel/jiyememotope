<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Larry Crowne movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2011)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In "Larry Crowne," Hanks plays a nice guy who gets fired from his retail job because he lacks the education to qualify him for a management position. This happens despite his countless awards for Employee of the Month. Larry cashes in his possessions, trades his car for a scooter and decides to enroll in a local community college. As his economics teacher he draws Dr. Matsutani (<a href=#>George Takei</a>), the only character in the film interesting enough to have a movie made about him. As his public speaking teacher, he gets Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts), a character who seems to have drifted over from the auditions for "<a href=#>Bad Teacher</a>."</p><p>The story arc is simplicity itself: Larry Crowne is a nice man who becomes nicer with the encouragement of other nice people. He eventually inspires the bad teacher to become a good teacher, abandon her porn-surfing loser of a husband, cure herself of alcoholism and fall in love with him. More than this a nice guy cannot be expected to do.</p><p>I watched the movie with all the pleasure I bring to watching bread rise. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy watching bread rise, but it lacks a certain degree of interest. You look forward to it being finished.</p><p>Larry is assisted in his lifestyle transition by the fetching Talia (<a href=#>Gugu Mbatha-Raw</a>), who supervises a makeover; he ditches the regular-guy duds for basic black and gets a cool haircut. He also becomes a member of her motor scooter club, which is like a motorcycle gang of environmentalists. How many scooter clubs are there in Los Angeles? Don't tell me. I don't want to know.</p><p>There is also character interest from his neighbors, Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer) and B'Ella (<a href=#>Taraji P. Henson</a>), but that's what they're in the movie for: character interest. They don't seem essential.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lmKuqqWKws7vWp5xmamBmfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-jynxzi-get-arrested-age-real-name-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Did Jynxzi Get Arrested?
