<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>We Have a Ghost movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Based on a short story called Ernest&nbsp;by <a href=#>Geoff Manaugh</a>, “We Have a Ghost” opens with the Presley family moving to a fixer-upper in Chicago. Father Frank (<a href=#>Anthony Mackie</a>) is struggling to make ends meet and to maintain a healthy relationship with his increasingly-distant son Kevin (Jahi Di’Allo Winston, so good in “<a href=#>Charm City Kings</a>” and on “Everything Sucks!”). Almost immediately after their arrival, Kevin is exploring the attic when he encounters a trapped soul named Ernest (<a href=#>David Harbour</a>, giving a silent performance). Ernest can’t talk but has been scaring away inhabitants since the ‘70s when he died. Kevin doesn’t get scared. He films Ernest with his phone, and there’s suddenly a viral ghost.</p><p>Imagine if there was an actual ghost all over TikTok and YouTube. What would happen? Landon doesn’t do nearly enough with this rich concept and just has&nbsp;people screaming outside the Presley home, including a guy dressed like Jesus. It’s interesting to watch Frank try to use Ernest’s existence as a cash infusion, becoming a cultural agent of sorts. He even brings in a local medium for an encounter with Ernest, a scene that allows for one of the film’s more impressive effects and potential memes from a <a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge</a> cameo. But there’s not enough done with the idea of what proof of the afterlife would mean. It doesn’t have to be deeply philosophical, but even a little shallow exploration might have filled this concept out a bit.</p><p>Instead, “We Have a Ghost” shifts too much focus to a paranormal scientist named Dr. Leslie Monroe (<a href=#>Tig Notaro</a>) and her CIA boss Arnold Schipley (<a href=#>Steve Coulter</a>). Landon’s film becomes something of a chase/road movie in its midsection as Ernest, Kevin, and their scene-stealing neighbor Joy (<a href=#>Isabella Russo</a>) try to escape the armed guards and get to the bottom of why this poor guy hasn’t fully moved to the next plane of existence. Of course, “We Have a Ghost” becomes a bit of a whodunit too as Ernest learns about what really happened to him, including the identity of his killer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wnGagkauybq2MoJ%2Boq6RiurDCyJ5kq52mnrK4eZFpaWw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deborah-elizabeth-sawyer-doja-cat-mother.html><span>←</span><span>Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer; Doja Ucing Indung, Umur, Net patut, Salaki.</span></a>
